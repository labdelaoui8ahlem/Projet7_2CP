                        Right now, the tool supports detection of several common tactics such as PingEcho, Maintain Multiple Copies, and Id Password. We plan to expand this list as the tool evolves.

                        You can upload plain text files that contain execution traces. Just make sure the file has a correct structure as provided in the uploading page so the parser can do its job effectively.

                        Your file is only used temporarily during the analysis and is not stored afterward. Your data stays private and secure.

                        It's great for developers, students, software architects, or anyone working with execution traces who wants quick and clear architectural insights â€” without doing all the heavy lifting manually.

                        Absolutely! Once your trace is analyzed, you can export the results either as a JSON file , TXT file or a PDF file to use in reports, documentation, or further analysis.
